"""
The script path is always relative to the Snakefile containing the directive
(in contrast to the input and output file paths, which are relative to the working
directory). It is recommended to put all scripts into a subfolder scripts as above.

Inside the script, you have access to an object `snakemake` that provides access to
the same objects that are available in the run and shell directives
(input, output, params, wildcards, log, threads, resources, config),
e.g. you can use snakemake.input[0] to access the first input file of above rule.
