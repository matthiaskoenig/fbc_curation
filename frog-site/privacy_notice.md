# Privacy notice and terms of service for the Online FROG

We, the maintainers of [runfrog.de](https://runfrog.de), know you care how information about you is used. We appreciate that you trust us to use your information carefully and sensibly. This notice describes the Online FROG privacy policy.

By using the Online FROG facilities of [runfrog.de](https://runfrog.de), you agree to accept the practices, limitations and disclaimers described below. 

## Can you avoid submitting any information?

If you prefer to have greater privacy, you can avoid using the Online FROG by downloading [fbc_curation](https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/fbc_curation) (which contains the report engine) and running [fbc_curation](https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/fbc_curation) on your own private computer. This avoids the need to enter any information to this online service or uploading any models to [runfrog.de](https://runfrog.de). 

## What information does this service gather?

This system receives and stores any information you enter on this website, and in addition, it uses some of the information you provide directly to infer other information automatically. The following describes what we gather:

* The Internet Protocol (IP) address from which [runfrog.de](https://runfrog.de) facility is accessed;
* The date and time at which this service is accessed;
* The pages accessed (recorded as the file names accessed on the server);
* Any file or SBML model you upload or paste in to this service;
* Any errors or warnings generated by the systems implementing this facility, including but not limited to the web server software and the Google analytics system described below; and
* Statistics such as the length of time that report took to perform, the errors or warnings generated by the report, and similar data computed by the report; and 

# Does this service store your SBML model or file?

This service is implemented as a server-side facility, meaning that the computations are physically performed on our computers. As a consequence, your SBML file or pasted-in text must be transmitted to, and stored temporarily on, our servers in order to process it. This online system also collects and stores the following information automatically, as described in the section titled What information does this service gather? above.

In the event that this service itself exhibits an error, the FROG Team may need to inspect the material you submitted (i.e., the SBML file or pasted-in text) to ascertain the cause of the error in the Online FROG system.

Your SBML file or pasted-in text, the IP address data, and the page data will never be passed willingly to any third party, and it will be deleted after a period of time. Your SBML file/text will only be used for the purposes of creating reports, for gathering general statistics about the uses of this service, and for debugging the service itself (and then, only if necessary). By submitting content to this validation service, you grant the FROG Team the right to use and store your file temporarily for these purposes. 

## How are Google Analytics used on this website?

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help this website analyze how users use this site. The information generated by the cookies about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. By using the [runfrog.de](https://runfrog.de) website, including the Online FROG, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out here. 

## How do we use information about you and your models?

We use the information you provide, and other information we gather, in the following ways:

* To provide the mechanisms to perform a best-effort report of any SBML files or models you upload or otherwise supply to this service. 
  
* To gather general statistics about the SBML contents uploaded to this service, for the following purposes:
  * Help us understand how the service is used, 
  * Help us improve the design and implementation of this service, 
  * Provide data to enable us to write articles and other reports about the use of FROG and this service. 

These uses of your SBML content do not involve analyzing or interpreting the meaning of the model uploaded to this service; these processes only concern the usage of SBML. We do not need to attempt to understand what you are modeling in order to perform the analyses described above. Rest assured that we have no need or interest in trying to understand your model, or its purpose. The temporary storage of your model is only necessary to implement this report service, and the statistics gathered on all SBML models only focus on the uses of SBML constructs.

Only the core staff members in charge of maintaining [runfrog.de](https://runfrog.de) and this service will have access to these data. We will not willingly reveal identifying information, or associations between names and specific SBML models or other data, to anyone.
